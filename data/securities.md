# ONE ZERO Bank Guide on Securities Trading

## Using the mobile application

### Securities via the mobile application

It is possible to trade securities and use our trading system to buy stocks, have an easy overview, make instructions and follow stocks through the [securities page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/securities) in the mobile app.


## Types of Securities

### Most Commonly Known Types of Securities
* Stock: A type of security that allows an issuing company to raise capital from investors on the stock exchange. In return for the money they pay for the investment in the share, investors receive part of the ownership of the company and thus become partners in it. With the money the company receives from the public, it can purchase equipment, recruit employees and develop its products, new and existing, in instruction to expand its operations. Some companies distribute dividends-that is, shareholders participate in its profits by receiving cash, according to the number of shares they hold.
* Option: A warrant grants the right to purchase a certain share at a predetermined price and postpone part of the payment to a later date. This right is limited in time - usually 2-5 years (Our bank will have foreign warrants but will not be opened for trading but as a product of a company event).
* Unlike mutual funds, which usually have a rate set only once each trading day, ETFs are regularly traded on the stock exchange, similar to the way stocks are traded with ask and bid, although some of them have an option to trade like mutual funds at the end of the day.

### Which Subscription Plan Fits To Each Trader and Investor
For customers who typically take more than 3 instructions per month, the ONE PLUS subscription plan will probably suit them better. Others will probably be better suited to the ONE subscription plan.

All of the following fees are not being charged from any of ONE ZERO bank's clients:
* Fees for maintain a securities portfolio
* Depository fees

### Management fees and Custody Fees Explanation
In most of the Israeli banks, management fees are charges applied by investment managers for overseeing a client's investment portfolio. Typically expressed as a percentage of the assets under management (AUM), these fees cover the managers' expertise, time, and operational costs. In addition to management fees, banks often charge custody fees, which are fees for holding and safeguarding the securities in the client's portfolio. Both types of fees are common in various investment vehicles, including mutual funds and investment accounts. These fees directly impact the net returns of investors, making it essential for clients to understand these costs when evaluating the overall performance and potential returns of their investments. In ONE ZERO bank, non of our clients is being charged for management fees or custody fees.

### Third-Party Expenses
Third-party expenses incurred for securities transactions encompass both buying and selling expenses. These expenses are subject to variation depending on factors such as the type of security and the jurisdiction in which the transaction occurs. When executing transactions, these charges will be reflected either in the designated foreign currency account or the ILS checking account, depending on the customer's specified preference at the time of instruction submission. It's important to note that these expenses represent the actual costs borne by the bank during the execution of instructions. Consequently, the bank is unable to provide discounts or waive these charges. As such, customers should anticipate these expenses as part of their overall transaction costs and plan accordingly when engaging in securities trading activities. Please note that third-party expenses cannot be discounted or waived, as they represent the actual costs incurred during transaction execution. Expenses related to transactions involving third parties, such as brokers or the SEC, will be charged accordingly and reflected in either foreign currency or ILS checking accounts, depending on the client's preference at the time of instruction. Third party expenses may change from time to time (according to changes in taxes, levies, changes in law in each country, etc.). Active funds are not charged third-party expenses.

## ONE ZERO Trade Instructions Hours and Conditional instructions

You can call the Securities Team by calling *6700 during business day's hours.
Note that on holidays and holiday eves, the business day's hours may change.

### Trading, modifying and Canceling Trade Instructions
Should you encounter difficulty in canceling or modifying an existing instruction, or if you wish to cancel an instruction that has already been sent, our [Securities Team](/actions/securities_agent) is available to assist you during operational hours. We facilitate updates to existing instructions to ensure flexibility in your trading strategy.
ONE ZERO Bank allows changing an instruction through the Instructions button on the [securities instructions page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/securities/order-book) -> select an instruction line -> swipe right -> you see an option to cancel or edit an instruction.


### Mutual funds trading hours at TASE
For every type of fund there is a specific trading days and "שעה ייעודה".
Mutual funds trading days at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange are Sunday to Thursday, unless the mutual fund has exposure to foreign securities or foreign currency. In that case, they will be traded from Monday to Thursday.
Trading hours at TASE for mutual funds are Sunday from 09:30 AM to 3:00 PM, and on Monday through Thursday from 09:30 AM to 4:00 PM Israel Standard Time (IST).
You can also see the "שעה ייעודה" on the fund page at the app.
At the moment, we are allowed to trade only end-day funds, and in the future we will open also ETF’s that are trading through the day.


### Sending a Mutual Fund Order After "שעה ייעודה"
If you send an order after the "שעה ייעודה", it will send it for the next trading day of the fund.


### Long and Short Trading
In securities trading, Long and Short are common concepts representing two distinct investment strategies. A Long position involves buying a security with the expectation that its value will increase over time, allowing the investor to profit from the price appreciation. Conversely, a Short position entails selling a security that the investor does not currently own, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. This strategy is based on the belief that the security's price will decline, enabling the investor to repurchase it at a reduced cost and pocket the price difference as profit. Our platform supports Long trading, enabling you to buy securities for investment purposes. However, please note that while some ETFs offer inverse exposure, we do not currently support short trading directly. Short exposure can be achieved by purchasing ETFs with inverse exposure.

### Conditional instructions
Conditional instructions, triggered by predefined conditions, and available trading balance information, assist in executing transactions effectively. Our trading system currently supports limit (LMT) and market (MKT) instructions. Additionally, Stop limit trade instructions are available in the iOS version.
At this time, we do not offer Pre-Market, After-Market and Stop-Loss trading.

### Mutual Funds Orders
Buy/sell orders in mutual funds are different from those for stocks. ONE ZERO Bank allows to send orders during mutual fund trading hours using a KRN instruction, and the order will be executed at the end of the day. This type of order is unique to mutual funds. You will have the option to choose between sending the order for the same trading day or for the next trading day.


## Instruction Statuses

### Understanding Instruction Statuses
When managing your securities instructions, it's crucial to understand the various statuses they might hold. A pending status indicates a valid instruction that has yet to be executed, often due to factors such as failure to meet specified limits. If you've initiated a cancellation outside of trading hours and it's still pending once trading resumes, our [Securities Team](/actions/securities_agent) is available to assist you during business day's hours.

### Instruction Execution and Rejection Statuses
Once an instruction is executed, it means that a transaction has been completed between parties, fulfilling a buy or sell an instruction for a security. However, if an an instruction is rejected, it means it has been denied on the stock exchange for various reasons, and our team will investigate the matter during business day's hours.

### Instruction Modification and Expiration
Instructions may also be modified, such as updating a buy limit. An expired status indicates that the instruction has lapsed on the stock exchange, often due to a set expiration period or action cancellation. It's essential to monitor your instructions regularly to ensure timely execution.

### Settlement Process and Cancellation
Settlement of instructions refers to the process of transferring securities against monetary payment and vice versa. Until an operation settles, funds and securities remain with their respective parties. Additionally, instructions can be canceled either by the customer, the broker, or the bank, depending on the circumstances.

### Cancellation of mutual funds at TASE Orders
Canceling a mutual fund order is only possible if the trading hours for mutual funds have not ended.


### Fee Charge For Canceling Securities Order
If you placed an order and then canceled it subject to the cancelation rules, no additional fees will be charged for the order or its cancelation.

### Refund For Order That Has Been Canceled
If you canceled an order before it was executed, you won't be charged for it. If you are a customer of the ONE PLUS subscription plan and the order was included in your 10 free monthly orders benefit, the canceled order won't count towards it.

### Partial Execution and Validation
Instructions might also be partially executed, either due to reaching a limit or other factors such as trading market volatility at a given moment. A partially executed instruction refers to one that has been transmitted to the stock exchange but only partially fulfilled. Understanding these statuses is vital for effective securities management and decision-making.

## Viewing Pending Instructions and Instruction History

### Accessing Pending Instructions, History and Information of securities
To monitor your pending instructions and review their history, navigate to the [securities instructions page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/securities/order-book) through the Securities page. There you can access the instructions section, you can find a summary of instructions and transactions pending execution, as well as their historical data, and access details about your investment portfolio. This includes details such as the security name, instructions status, action, price, quantity, average unit price, instruction value, fees, total value, instruction date, execution date, instruction ID number, and the account involved.

## Debiting / Crediting Foreign Currency Accounts, Digital Currencies, Crypto Currencies, Transferring Investment Portfolio

### Available Currencies For Trading In Mutual Funds
When initiating transactions in mutual funds, you can use your ILS balance only. It's important to ensure that your account balance is sufficient before issuing purchase instructions, as insufficient balances might prevent the completion of the transaction.


### Investment Options and Policies for Digital Asset Exposure at ONE ZERO Bank
ONE ZERO Bank, in alignment with the bank's policy outlined on the website, provides access to ETF stocks that track digital currencies, which can be found in the Securities tab of the banking platform. These offerings allow customers to diversify their investment portfolios with exposure to digital assets. Additionally, ONE ZERO Bank does not support trading in digital currencies directly, but allows an option to trade ETFs that imitate digital currencies. This does not constitute a recommendation. Available securities for trading include stocks, ETFs, warrants, and select rights on the US stock exchange. Customers can choose whether to invest in ETFs that passively track market indices. You can view all ETFs that can be traded through the [securities store](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/securities/store).


### Available securities at TASE through ONE ZERO Bank
For now, it is only possible to trade mutual funds like active funds and tracking funds at TASE through ONE ZERO Bank.


### Settlement Process and Support for Foreign and Israeli Securities and Account Credits
Securities settlement in the United States and Israel operates on a T+1 cycle, where proceeds from the sale of securities usually appear in the account one business day after the execution date, except for Israeli mutual funds with exposure to foreign securities or foreign currency, which may settle after more than one business day. In case of delays or discrepancies in the crediting of funds, you can contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) for assistance. Additionally, it's important to know that when you are buying or selling stock at US market you will get an option to choose between ILS account or USD account, except if you don’t have a USD account, then you will be charged or credited from the ILS account instead. Contact information for private bankers is available on the banking platform, and inquiries are typically addressed during the Securities Department's operating hours.

### Transfer of Securities Portfolio during Bank Migration
Currently, ONE ZERO Bank does not support the migration of securities portfolios from third-party accounts to ONE ZERO Bank accounts. The bank is actively working on implementing this feature to facilitate the seamless transfer of investment holdings for its customers. However, ONE ZERO Bank does support the migration of portfolios from ONE ZERO Bank accounts to third-party accounts.

## Securities That Doesn't Exist On The ONE ZERO Bank Securities Store

### Foreign Securities That Doesn't Exist On The ONE ZERO Bank Securities Store
If you can't find securities stocks on the ONE ZERO bank securities store and wish to consider adding them, you can contact the [securities team](/actions/attach_agent)

### Trading BlackRock, Irish Funds, ISHARES Through ONE ZERO Bank
At this stage, ONE ZERO bank cannot support trading in Irish funds that trade on TASE and cannot add this specific fund to the securities store of ONE ZERO Bank. Stay tuned for updates on the availability of Irish funds trading, which will be announced through official channels.

## Regulations including SEC, Notifications, Payment Changes, ADR Fees

### SEC Fees and Subscription Plan Implications
When engaging in securities transactions, customers might encounter third-party expenses (except of active funds), such as SEC fees, which are applicable even under fee-less subscription plans. Notably, starting from the 11th transaction within a given month, customers, including those on fee-less subscription plans, will incur charges akin to the ONE subscription plan.

### Notifications and Security Actions
The bank disseminates information regarding various securities actions through multiple channels, ensuring customers remain informed about relevant developments. Updates on forthcoming securities actions are available on designated websites, enabling you to stay abreast of pertinent information. You will be notified about dividends in your messages box, where you can find confirmation messages for the dividend payments received in your foreign currency account, and about various security actions which are promptly delivered whenever the bank becomes aware of any relevant actions.

### Securities Appearances and Unexpected Actions
Occasionally, customers might observe securities appearing in their bank accounts despite not initiating purchases. This occurrence can be attributed to events such as mergers or exchanges, or due to the issuance of purchase instructions.

### Payment Cancellations, Changes, and ADR Fees
Changes in payment details can lead to the cancellation of payments, necessitating the initiation of fresh payment instructions. Furthermore, custodians retain the authority to cancel payments if required. ADR fees, associated with actions or the continuous maintenance of ADR securities, are imposed as third-party expenses, aligning with the actual charges borne by the bank. If our custodian charges us for a certain activity of the customer, the charge will be transferred to the customer. The bank usually cannot know in advance about the third-party commission (unlike bank and broker fees where there is an agreement).

## Corporate Actions, Company Events, Splits, Dividends

### Understanding Corporate Actions
Corporate actions encompass significant changes within a company, often approved by the board of directors. Shareholders may be involved in decision-making processes, particularly for actions like dividend selections or mergers. Mandatory actions require shareholder participation, while voluntary actions offer choices to shareholders.

### Dividends
The dividend announcement date marks the board of directors' decision on dividends. Dividend payments are calculated based on your holding multiplied by the published rate. If you notice any discrepancies, contact the bankers for a review. An investor can receive a dividend in cash or company shares. In a mandatory dividend action, shareholder participation is required, while in a voluntary dividend action, shareholders have choices.

### Dividend Yield
A financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It is calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the stock price per share.

### Dividend Policy
The policy a company uses to decide how much it will pay out to shareholders in dividends.

### Ex-Dividend Date
The date on or after which a security is traded without a previously declared dividend. After this date, the seller, not the buyer, is entitled to the dividend.

### Securities Execution and Fraction Calculation
Securities might not appear due to splits or expired instructions. Fraction calculations in mergers, spin-offs, and exchanges are based on entitlement multiplied by the security rate. In reverse splits, it's the last known rate multiplied by the ratio, while in stock splits, it's divided by the ratio.

### Securities splits
Splits in the context of corporate actions refer to events where the number of shares held by shareholders changes, often without altering the total value of their holdings. One type of split is a reverse split, where the number of shares outstanding is reduced, usually to increase the stock price. This can occur when a company's shares have depreciated significantly, and a higher price per share is desired. In contrast, a stock split involves dividing each existing share into multiple shares, effectively increasing the number of outstanding shares. Stock splits are typically done to make shares more affordable to investors and increase liquidity in the market. Both types of splits can impact shareholder equity and the overall perception of the company in the market.

## Bonds

### Explanation of Bonds
Bonds enables companies and the government to raise money from the public, in a process similar to that in which we take a loan from ONE ZERO bank. The company issuing the bond returns the debt to us at a predetermined date. At the moment, ONE ZERO Bank does not support trading in bonds, but trading in ETFs and mutual funds that have exposure to bond assets is supported.

## Investment Portfolio and Consultation Services, Trading system review

### Market Hours US Securities Exchange Market in Israel
The current trading hours of the US securities exchange market in Israel Standard Time (IST) are Monday to Friday from 4:30 PM to 11:00 PM, corresponding to the standard U.S. market hours.

### Changes Outside Market Hours
The value of your securities portfolio can change after the US market closed due to several reasons:
* A change in the value of the foreign currency.
* A change in the security price.
* Future payment of a receivable dividend/interest.


### Market Hours TASE
The current trading hours at TASE are Sunday from 10:00 AM to 3:50 PM, and Monday to Thursday from 10:00 AM to 5:25 PM Israel Standard Time (IST).


## Taxes and Regulations

### Taxes and Regulations
Israeli residents are subject to a 25% tax withholding for capital gains on transactions. Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charges a fee for security sale execution.

### Payment policy:
* Aggregate Mutual Fund does not distribute its profits to the participation unit holders as a dividend. The fund accumulates its profits and reinvests them in additional assets
* Profit-Sharing Fund does not accumulate its profits and distributes them as dividends to the holders of the participation units.
* Exempt Mutual Fund does not pay tax on its income, and therefore the investor in the fund will pay tax on real capital gains. A capital loss arising from the redemption of a unit in an exempt fund may be offset against capital gains tax on the sale of Israeli negotiable securities or on the redemption of units in exempt mutual funds.
* Liable Mutual Fund pays tax directly to the tax authorities according to the tax rates applicable to individuals. As a result, the capital gain to the investor generated at the time of redemption of the unit is exempt from capital gains tax, as is the dividend. A capital loss suffered in the redemption of a liable mutual fund does not allow for offsetting capital gains on other securities.


## Tracking Funds

### General Information About Tracking Funds
Tracking funds are a specific type of mutual fund whose purpose is to track a certain index, on a best effort basis, meaning - it does not commit to it. Most often, a tracking fund buys the assets that make up the index according to their weight but can also be exposed through derivatives or through investment in other tracking instruments (mainly abroad). Some funds may be exposed to currency, USD for example, and can cause a situation in which the index rises and the dollar USD falls, thereby cumulatively the return can be lower than expected or even negative. On the other hand, a currency-neutralized fund will only be exposed to changes in the index but carries within it the costs of neutralizing a currency. Tracking funds can be traded at ONE ZERO Bank.


### Types of Tracking Funds
These are types of tracking funds:
* Reverse exposure fund – Type of mutual fund whose investment policy states that its purpose is to achieve results that are negatively correlated with the rate of change in its reference asset. The reverse exposure is achieved by short selling the shares (short) or derivatives.
* Foreign Investment Fund – This is an exempt mutual fund with at least 90% of its investments in assets denominated in or linked to a particular foreign currency, and it defines itself as a main IMF. When calculating real capital gain in such a fund, a change in the exchange rate of the selected main currency is taken into account and not a change in the consumer price index.
* Kosher Fund – Type of mutual fund managed in accordance with the rules of Jewish law. The fund invests only in companies and assets that meet halachic criteria, such as a prohibition on investing in companies that profit from interest.


## Types of Active Funds

### General Information About Active Funds
Active fund is a type of mutual fund in which the fund manager has discretion in choosing assets, unlike index-tracking funds where the fund manager buys shares of a particular index.


### Types of Active Funds
These are types of tracking funds:
* Specialized fund – Type of active mutual fund in which most of its assets (at least 75%) are exposed to a particular investment channel. For example, a fund in which 75 percent of the fund is obligated to be invested in government bonds.
* Flexible fund – Type of active mutual fund that is not bound by a particular investment policy and is entitled to invest in any investment channel at the discretion of the fund manager, within the sector limits defined in the prospectus. For example, a fund that invests in indexed bonds as well as USD bonds and stocks.
* Leveraged fund – Type of active mutual fund whose exposure to stocks, foreign exchange or bonds can exceed, in absolute value, 200% of the net value of the fund's assets. A leveraged fund operates extensively in derivatives, short sales, etc. Investing in this fund involves higher risk than investing in other funds, and management fees are usually higher. For example, a leveraged fund has 2x, if the index has risen by 10%, the fund will strive to yield a return of 2 times, and if the index falls by 10%, then the fund is expected to decline by approximately 20%.
* Money Market Fund - Type of active mutual fund that invests in short-term, high-quality financial instruments like certificates of deposit, short-term government bonds, and commercial paper. It aims to provide a safe investment option with high liquidity and low risk, often maintaining a stable value per share.

* "שעה ייעודה" – mutual funds are not traded continuously but once a day by the hour of its designation, which is published in the fund's prospectus. The designated time is the end time during which a request for the creation or redemption of the Fund's units can be broadcast.
* Open-end fund -diversified portfolio of pooled investor money that can issue unlimited shares. The fund manager sells shares directly to investors and redeems them as well. These shares are priced daily based on their net asset value.

Its shares can then be bought and sold on a stock exchange, but no new shares will be created, and no new money will flow into the fund.

## Stop Limit Instruction User Guide

### Stop-limit Instruction Description
A stop-limit instruction is a conditional trade executed over a set time frame that combines the features of a stop instruction with those of a limit instruction, used primarily to mitigate risk. It is related to other types of instructions, including limit instructions (an instruction to either buy or sell a specified number of shares at a given price or better) and stop-on-quote instructions (an instruction to either buy or sell a security after its price has surpassed a specified point). The expiry date of a stop-limit instruction is defined by the user.

### Explanation About Using The stop-limit Instruction
A stop-limit instruction requires setting two price points: the stop price and the limit price. First, set the stop price, which is the price at which you want the trade to be triggered. If the price of the security (for a BUY instruction) reaches the stop price or (for a SELL instruction) falls below or equals the stop price, the instruction limit will be sent to the market once the trigger has been activated.
Next, set the limit price. The limit price is the price at which you want to buy or sell the security. This price is used to limit the maximum price you will pay or the minimum price you will receive for the trade. A time frame must also be set during which the stop-limit instruction is considered executable.
The stop-limit instruction will be executed at a specified price or better after a given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit instruction becomes a limit instruction to buy or sell at the limit price or better.
However, it's important to note that there is a risk the instruction may not be executed. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider market conditions and your trading objectives before placing a stop-limit instruction.
Trading with the Stop-Limit instruction is available through the [securities page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/securities).

### Modify or cancel Stop-Limit Instruction
Modifying or canceling a Stop-Limit instruction is possible as long as it has not been executed. It is important to monitor your instruction and make adjustments as needed based on market conditions. The stop-limit instruction would remain open until the limit price is met or the instruction expires.

### Potential Issues with Stop-Loss Instructions
If the stock price at the opening of the market is lower than the price set in the Stop-Loss, the instruction is likely not to be executed because the opening price of the stock was already below the price set for triggering the sale instruction.

### Stop-Limit Instruction Fees

There is no difference in fees between different types of instructions for securities trading at the bank. The fees are only charged for making instructions based on the user subscription plan.


### Stop-Loss vs Stop-Limit Instruction

In a Stop-Loss (stop market) instruction, when the price triggers, a market instruction is transmitted, whereas in a Stop-Limit instruction, a limit instruction is transmitted. Stop-Loss and Stop-Limit instructions can provide different types of protection for both long and short investors. Stop-Loss instructions offer more guarantee of execution, while Stop-Limit instructions guarantee the price. As of today, the bank does not support the Stop-Loss instruction type.


### Stop-Limit Instructions Advantages

* Controlled Price Execution: With a stop-limit instruction, it is possible to set a limit price higher or lower than the stop price, depending on whether you are buying or selling. This control ensures you enter or exit trades at preferred prices, minimizing unfavorable fills.
* Effective Risk Management: Setting a stop price helps limit potential losses if the market moves against you. Meanwhile, specifying a limit price prevents execution at undesirable prices, thereby managing risk effectively.
* Automated Execution: Once placed, the stop-limit instruction is automatically sent to the market when the stop price is reached. This automation allows for hands-free execution, ideal for traders preferring a more passive approach or unable to monitor the market continuously.
* Versatile Trading Tool: Suitable for various strategies such as day trading, swing trading, and position trading, stop-limit instruction provide flexibility to enter or exit trades, catering to different trading styles and objectives.


### Stop-Limit Instruction Disadvantages

* Execution Control with Potential Risks: While a stop-limit instruction enables control over trade entry and exit prices, there is no assurance of execution. If the market moves swiftly and fails to reach your limit price, your instruction may remain unfilled, particularly problematic in volatile markets with rapid price fluctuations.
* Vulnerability to Price Gaps: Stop-limit instructions may not safeguard against price gaps, where a security's price leaps from one level to another without trades in between. If your limit price isn't met during a price gap, you risk being filled at a significantly worse price than anticipated.
* Psychological Pressure: Triggered stop-losses can tempt traders to hold positions in hopes of market reversals, leading to emotional decision-making and potential harm to overall trading strategies.
* Complexity Compared to Other Instructions: Setting up and executing stop-limit instructions can be more intricate than market or limit instructions. Traders must grasp the nuances of setting stop and limit prices and comprehend how these factors interact within the market environment.
