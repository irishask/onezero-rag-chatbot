### Viewing card transactions and card fees

You can view the transactions and fees on your card in the credit card company - [Isracard](https://digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/transaction-list/)'s application.



## Traveling Abroad

### What do you need to know before traveling abroad?

A few important things you should know before traveling:

* You should update the credit card company (Isracard) before your trip and let them know the destination country so that Isracard authorizes transactions abroad as well.
* Transaction confirmation messages are sent only via SMS to the mobile number registered with the credit card company. Therefore, it is advisable to update the credit card company with your current number before traveling.
* It is also recommended to remember the PIN code if you wish to withdraw funds.
* We also recommend reviewing your subscription plan before you travel as there are subscription plans that grant you benefits in foreign-currency transactions:
  * In the ONE subscription plan and ONE PLUS subscription plan, no conversion fees will be charged for transactions made with the card.
  * In ONE subscription plan and ONE PLUS subscription plan, only when withdrawing foreign currency abroad, a withdrawal fee of 2% of the withdrawal amount will be charged.
  * On the ZERO subscription plan, a 2% commission is charged for foreign currency card transactions.
  * On the ZERO subscription plan, a 3% fee will be charged for foreign currency ATM withdrawals, both in Israel and abroad.

If you are on the ZERO subscription plan, you might want to consider upgrading to the ONE subscription plan through the [subscription plans page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/settings/selectPlan) before you travel, to enjoy benefits abroad including foreign-currency transactions at with no exchange fees.



### Card Assistance abroad

If you are abroad and need to make transactions, you can contact [Isracard's customer service](https://digital.isracard.co.il/Abroad/lobby/Abroad/CustomerService/), or on WhatsApp (+972548947598) or by phone +97236364666, or through their app [Isracard Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.isracard.hatavot) [Isracard Apple app](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/isracard-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%98/id489783331) (which should be downloaded before traveling). Alternatively, you can submit a request for a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) to check with the credit card company for you.



### AIG Travel Insurance abroad

The insurance is on behalf of AIG for five days. The benefit is given to Israeli residents with an Israeli ID card, aged 18-85. You can [view the insurance terms](https://digital.isracard.co.il/Abroad/lobby/before/insuranceactivation2/).



## Cash Withdrawals

### Cash withdrawal fees from ATMs in Israel using ONE ZERO credit card or debit card

Cash withdrawal from an ATM belonging to any bank in Israel is free of withdrawal fees. Private ATMs companies charge their own fees, therefore, we recommend that you withdraw cash from bank-run ATMs connected to a branch in order to avoid these fees. It is not possible to withdraw money without a card. If you withdrew cash from an ATM with operating or third-party fees, then the fee is from the ATM operator, not ONE ZERO bank.



### Handling Cash Withdrawal Failures

Handling failures in ATM withdrawals differs between ATMs in Israel and those abroad:
* Failures in withdrawals from ATMs in Israel – If you attempted to withdraw cash from an ATM in Israel and no cash was dispensed, but you still see a charge on your account, it is generally recommended to wait three business days for the funds to be credited back. If, after three business days, you have not received a refund, you can contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) for further assistance. Please specify the ATM location and the withdrawal amount. If you used a debit card, the withdrawal may not be finalized and could appear as a pending transaction. In this case, you should wait 24 hours to ensure that the pending charge is removed.
* Failures in withdrawals from ATMs abroad – If you attempted to withdraw cash from an ATM abroad and the transaction failed, please contact [Isracard's customer service](https://digital.isracard.co.il/Abroad/lobby/Abroad/CustomerService/) for assistance.



### Cash Withdrawals limit using ONE ZERO Credit Card

The daily limit for cash withdrawal from ATM with ONE ZERO bank's Credit Card is different between withdrawals abroad and withdrawals inside Israel's borders:
* Withdrawal from ATM inside Israel borders with Credit Card - With your ONE ZERO bank credit card, you can withdraw cash up to 10,000 ILS per day from any ATM inside Israel borders. If you can not withdraw all 10,000 ILS at once, you can probably do it in two strokes. The daily withdrawal limit in one stroke on your credit card is 8,000 ILS. However, there is a fee for withdrawals from a private ATM that will be charged to the ATM company. We recommend that you withdraw cash from bank-run ATMs connected to a branch. Notice that there is no cash withdrawal without the bank card.
* Withdrawal from ATM abroad with a Credit Card - With your ONE ZERO bank credit card, your cash withdrawal limitation from ATM abroad is based on your credit card's lines of credit. As long as your credit card's lines of credit isn't completed, you can keep use it to withdraw cash from ATMs abroad.



### Cash Withdrawals limit using ONE ZERO Debit Card

The daily limit for cash withdrawal from ATM with ONE ZERO bank's Debit Card is different between withdrawals abroad and withdrawals inside Israel's borders:
* Withdrawal from ATM inside Israel borders with Debit Card - You can make purchases of up to 3,000 ILS per single transaction and to withdraws up to 5,000 ILS per day from any ATM inside Israel borders. For purchases exceeding 3,000 ILS on the debit card, therefore you will have to ask the merchant to split the bill into two payments.
* Withdrawal from ATM abroad with a Debit Card - You can withdraw up to 3,000 ILS per day from ATMs abroad, as long as there is remaining balance in your account.



### Double charge by ATM

If you tried to make a withdrawal and were charged twice, or received a different amount than you requested to withdraw And you did not receive the money, the ATM system performs an automatic count at the end of the business day, and if there is a discrepancy, it does not charge the account. If 3 business days have passed, and the charge is still deducted from your account, and no automatic credit has been received, notify a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) for further assistance regarding the request while specifying where the withdrawal was made and for what amount.



### Depositing cash

At this time, cash deposits are still not possible to ONE ZERO Bank accounts. However, the bank is working on making cash deposits possible and will update all customers as soon as it becomes possible. You can transfer money into your account from an account in another bank and deposit cheques.



## Card Delivery and Activation Process

### Card shipping companies and delivery time and identification

The cards at ONE ZERO Bank are sent to customers via a service called Quick to Mailbox in partnership with Israel Post.

## Ordering a card

### Why you need to have a card

To complete the account-opening process, you need to order a card. As a digital bank without physical branches, the only way to access your money is with the card, which is issued as soon as you open the account. Each customer can order one card of any type: debit or credit (depending on the bank's approval). In order for your application to be examined, you must first approve your consent for a credit report. For each customer in each bank account, at least one card and at most one card of each type (credit card and debit card) can be issued. You can order new card on the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards). Navigate to the Cards page, where you can manage your existing cards and order new ones.

### Failure to order card via app

If you cannot order a credit card in the app or would like to check out a credit card line of credit amount other than what was approved for you in the app, you can submit a [manual request for line of credit](/actions/misgarot). If needed, a banker from the credit department will get back to you and explain what documents they need, as this varies from request to request depending on the client. The bank issues Isracard credit cards to its customers, not other types such as Visa. All bank cards are issued from Isracard. You can issue a new card through [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards). When your card is about to expire, a new card will be sent to you. Upon receipt, you will be required to activate the new card, thereby canceling the old card from future use.



### Correcting Spelling mistakes on Received Cards

If you received a card with spelling errors, to correct the writing with the credit card company, please send a request to the private banker and specify your name in English, or alternatively attach a photo of your passport showing your name, and the credit card company will send you a new card with the correct details. If your last name on the card doesn't appear in full, it might be because there is a maximum character limit of 20 characters, in which case, the last name will be shortened.

## Dealing with Transaction Failures

### Declined transactions

A card charge might be declined for several reasons:

1. For debit cards, it is important to first make sure that the account has enough funds to cover the charge.
2. Debit cards have a single debit limit of 3,000 ILS (a charge for a larger amount will be deferred) and a daily withdrawal limit of 5,000 ILS.
3. For credit cards, make sure that the line of credit is enough to cover the charge. You can view the amount utilized on the card through the app or on the [Isracard website](https://digital.isracard.co.il/). If you still cannot use the card, contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) for further assistance.



## Pending Transactions

### What are Pending Transactions

A pending charge is a charge that has been registered on your card but has not yet received final approval. Within 24 hours of clearing, you will be able to view the final billing and full transaction details on Isracard's website or app when logged into your personal area. Transactions made using a debit card (direct card) are pending final approval for approximately 3 business days until they are actually debited, and therefore they place a hold on the amount expected to be charged in the checking account.



## Connecting Cards to Digital Wallets

You can also sign up for the Google Pay service using the Isracard app by opening the app, selecting "Sign up to Google Pay", choosing the desired card, and clicking Add to Google Pay. Google does not limit the number of cards that can be added to the Google Pay service. Isracard app or website has streamlined the process for linking your card to Google Pay directly from their platform, making it convenient for users. If you added more than one card to your Google Pay, the first card added will automatically be the default card and will open automatically on your next purchase. If you are interested in changing the default charge card, sign in to the Google Pay app, click on the desired card, and select "Set as default for contactless payment". Google Pay is the most secure service for transactions as your charge card information will never be transferred to the business venue when making a transaction.

Apple allows up to 8 charge cards to be linked to the Apple Pay service. All charge cards linked to the Apple Pay app must belong to the same owner (with the same ID number). You can change this setting and select any other card to be the default card at any time. If you added more than one card to your Apple Pay, the first card added will automatically be the default card. To change the default card for Apple Pay, go to iPhone settings -> Wallet & Apple Pay -> select the desired card under "Transaction Defaults". Apple Pay is the most secure method for transactions as your charge card information will never be transferred to the business venue when making a transaction.

### Digital Wallet Transactions and Refunds

If you would like to talk about a transaction in the digital wallet, note that a refund made using the digital wallet will also be seen through the wallet app.



## Choosing and Changing a Billing Day of Month

### Choosing a Billing Day

A billing day corresponds to when the credit card is charged. On this date, all charges you made with the debit card at merchants will be debited from your account. The billing days for the cards are the 2nd, 10th, 15th or 20th of the month, whichever is most convenient for you. You can check your card billing day on the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards).

If your card is charged before your salary is paid, causing discrepancies in payment and even an unarranged overdraft in your account, you have the option to change the card's billing day to a more convenient time. The existing billing days at ONE ZERO Bank are: 2, 10, 15, 20. It is important to know that the next billing date will appear for the first time after completion of the current month and completion of a full consecutive month. This means that if you choose to change your billing date on January 15, the change will only begin in March of that year. If you want to change the billing day, contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent). It is recommended to know your billing day and prepare for it every month. You can view your billing day on the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards).



### Credit Card Billing Cycles

A credit card line of credit defines the total amount of all credit card transactions that can be made during a billing cycle. The monthly billing cycle is once a month on a predetermined billing day (2nd/10th/15th/20th) and can be changed. When the chosen billing date arrives, your account will be charged the full amount of the line of credit granted to you that you have used.



### When will the billing change take action

It is recommended to know your billing day and prepare for it every month. Once requested, the payment day change will take effect within a maximum of 30 days.

If you see duplicate transactions in your account that were not made by you, you can dispute the transaction by going to the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards), tapping More Actions, selecting Dispute Transactions, choosing the requested transaction and the reason for the dispute ("I was charged twice"). The credit card company clarify with the business, and at the end of it, the credit card company will update you.



### Unfamiliar transactions

If there is a transaction you don't recognize on the card, you can block the business from future card charges through Isracard. In addition, it is also possible to perform a charge back, and Isracard will conduct an inquiry with the business (we as a bank are not a party to the matter). This can be done through the Isracard website -> Statements button -> click the transaction in question -> click [Transaction Inquiry](https://digital.isracard.co.il/products-services/credit_charges).



## Card Actions

### What to do if your card is lost or stolen

If your credit card has been lost or stolen, it is recommended to temporarily block the old card, or freezing it instead of immediate cancellation provides the opportunity to search for the card if there is a chance it's simply misplaced. The fastest way to cancel the card is on the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards) -> tap More Actions -> Cancel Card. You can also cancel the card via the [credit card company website](https://digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/Login/?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.isracard.co.il%2Fcardcancellation). If you lost your card and ordered a new one, you will receive a card with a different number for security reasons, but the card type will be the same as the previous card. If you received a text message that your credit card was blocked, you should contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) for assistance.



### Freezing and unfreezing lost and found cards

If the card is cancelled, it will not be possible to reactivate it, unlike a frozen card, which can always be unfrozen. If your credit card has been blocked, usually due to a prolonged overdraft in the account, you can verify that the overdraft has been settled in full. After verifying, you can contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) to examine the release of the block, if possible, assuming the unarranged overdraft has already been settled. You can temporarily block a card by freezing it through the app with the Freeze button under the Cards tab. The card will be blocked for 3 days. If the freeze is not canceled before the end of this time frame, the card will be automatically canceled, and a new card will be issued in its place. The card will be blocked for 3 days. You will need to activate the new card in the app. If the freeze is not canceled before the end of this time frame, the card will be automatically canceled, and a new card will be issued in its place. The new card will be sent via Israel Post in up to 7 business days. You will need to activate the new card in the app. Isracard's card cancellation days are Mondays and Thursdays.
Reactivating a blocked card depends on the type of block: if it is blocked and canceled, it cannot be reactivated at all. You can order a new card easily on the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards) -> click on the Order button -> choose the Order a New Card option -> select credit card or debit card. You can temporarily block a card by selecting the card you want to block on cards page, clicking the three dots in the top-left corner of the page and choose "Freeze Card". The card will be blocked for 3 days. If the freeze is not canceled before the end of this time frame, the card will be automatically canceled, and a new card will be issued in its place. The new card will be sent via Israel Post in up to 7 business days. You will need to activate the new card in the app. Isracard's card cancellation days are Mondays and Thursdays. If you would like to reactivate a temporarily blocked card, you must make a reservation with a private banker by the cancellation day. To unfreeze a card that was temporarily frozen due to loss, you must use the Isracard app or contact an Isracard telephone service representative. If the card was frozen for reasons other than loss, you may contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) for further assistance.



### Unarranged overdraft and blocked cards

A frozen card cannot be used until the card is unfrozen. When a card is frozen, any future or installment charges will continue to be charged on time according to the original terms of the transaction. Reactivating a blocked card depends on the type of block: if it is blocked and canceled, it cannot be reactivated at all. You can order a new card easily on the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards) -> click on the Order button -> choose the Order a New Card option -> select credit card or debit card. If the card is frozen contact our private bankers for assistance.



### Disputing Charges and Transactions

If you notice unauthorized or fraudulent charges on your credit card statement, it is crucial to act promptly. Immediately report them to your credit card issuer for clarification. Your issuer might temporarily credit your account while conducting the clarification. In order to handle the issue, we would appreciate it if you could send us documents or any additional documentation that is relevant to the charge you did not identify. You can contact the merchant directly to request a refund according to their refund policy.
If the merchant is unable or unwilling to process the refund, you can initiate a [charge back through Isracard](https://digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/Login/?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.isracard.co.il%2Fcardcancellation) for ONE ZERO cards or the card issuer of your external card for non-bank cards. Work closely with your issuer to resolve the dispute and ensure that any fraudulent activity is addressed promptly.
If needed, you can contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) who will be happy to assist you on this issue.



## Card Transactions

### Online payments

When paying online with a ONE ZERO card, you will often be asked to enter a 4-digit code that you receive from Isracard in a text message for security confirmation.



### Credit Card vs. Debit Card Transactions

Credit card charges appear 48 hours after the transaction and are deducted from your account on the billing day you set. On the other hand, debit card charges are deducted immediately after the transaction is executed. Transactions made on the debit card wait for final approval three business days until they are actually charged and therefore reserve funds from the checking account. Debit transactions made on the same day usually add up to one total charge. You can view the full details of the transactions on the Isracard website or app 48 hours after the execution of the transaction. If you are interested in a breakdown of the billing expenses on your cards, you can see your credit card statement on the My Account page under the Cards tab. Details of card transactions can be viewed in a centralized form on Isracard's website or app in the personal area.



## Non-bank Cards (External Cards)

### Bank Cards vs. Non-bank cards comparison

If a card is issued by us, it is a bank card. Non-bank cards are cards issued outside the bank by various credit card companies and not through the bank. You can consider issuing a credit card in our app and enjoy the many benefits of having ONE ZERO bank card. There are non-bank cards, which can be ordered directly from the credit card company. It can be ordered from Isracard or other credit card companies for employees in organizations and workplaces that offers benefits for flying abroad, special conditions, branding and more. A non-bank card is not a bank account. More information about Isracard's corporate card can be found on [Isracard's corporate page](https://marketing.isracard.co.il/clubs/corporate/). Credit card companies provide non-bank services such as financial services, including credit card issuance, clearing services, loans, credit solutions and payment options. These companies provide world-class services to local credit card companies such as Isracard, Max and Cal. A non-bank card can be associated with any bank account you have and from which you want to deduct the card payment. Cards of this type have a line of credit set by the credit card company based on their judgment. On the card's billing day, an instruction is sent to download the charges received on the card to the bank account with which it is associated. For a non-bank card that charges your account with us, on the day the card is charged you must ensure that you have sufficient balance in the account in order to charge the authorization. On a bank card, the full account number appears on the back of the card at the bottom, below the card number. A bank card is a card issued by the credit card company that works with the bank and is debited from the account from which it was issued. This type of card has many advantages with affordable benefits and convenient viewing of data without the need to go to the credit card company's website. With a bank credit card, the credit line is set by the bank itself and not by the credit card company in order to optimize the adjustment to your needs. The bank works with Isracard for the benefit of bank cards. The credit cards issued by Isracard at the bank are debit cards and platinum credit cards. The charges and information on the credit cards are visible to the cardholder, who can view all the charges and their details in the bank application and at the credit card company.



### Link non-bank credit card

You can issue a non-bank card from other credit card companies and link it to your account using an account billing authorization. To do this, you can contact the appropriate credit card company to order the card. You can associate bank and non-bank cards with your account here, whose charges will be deducted from the account. A card belonging to another bank, cannot be associated with an account here. However, it can be transferred and all card data copied to the account here of your choice. In addition, you can link non-bank cards to an account by setting a billing authorization, and then viewing an installation certificate for the authorization to the institution. We allow our customers to link their non-bank credit cards to the app to make it convenient and easy for them to view charges.

You can link non-bank cards on their provider websites:

* [Link Isracard cards](https://digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/Login/?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fdigital.isracard.co.il%2Fpersonalarea%2Fagreementmanagement%2F).
* [Link Max cards](https://www.max.co.il/login?ReturnURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.max.co.il%2Fagreements%2Fpersonal%2Fupdate-banks).

Customers can contact a private banker for assistance with specific card-related tasks, including checking transaction status, resolving errors, or seeking guidance on credit-related matters. The bank's products are for the customer's use only and for account security, it is recommended that only the account holder use the bank's products, thus your spouse cannot withdraw funds from your account even with your permission.

## Card Security and Privacy

### Suggestions for Keeping your card secure

To keep your credit card or debit card secure, don't share the card or its details. Keep your credit card in a safe place. The card security code (the CVV) should remain confidential and known only to you. Monitor transactions in your account, track your card's charges, activate notifications about card charges via text message or email, and check them frequently. When you make a purchase online, use only secure sites, look for a lock icon in the address bar to protect your credit card information. Keep the card's PIN code in a safe place and not with the card itself, but rather far from it. When using the PIN code, make sure that nobody nearby can see it, and at ATMs, cover the keypad when typing it in. If your card is lost or stolen, report it to your credit card company immediately to refuse its unauthorized use. If you wish to make a payment in installments for a charge already made to the card, this service can be provided by the credit card company for the number of installments you desire easily and conveniently on the [Isracard website/app](https://web.isracard.co.il/debtinstallments). In order to maintain our customers' accounts and ensure that the card is used only by the account holder, the courier is obligated to deliver only to them. The courier must identify the cardholder using an ID or driver's license, and only after verification (and delivery of the card) do we activate it. This ensures that no one else will be using the card.



### Secure Payments

ONE ZERO bank cards are personal and cannot be transferred or used by anyone else, so you cannot let anyone use your card, including your account partner. It is not possible to add an authorized user to your personal card. The ONE ZERO credit cards and debit cards supports 3D Secure (3DS), an information security protocol used to securely execute online transactions. This standard ensures the highest level of security for all parties to the transaction: the payee, the card issuer, and the intermediary between them.



### Understanding Payment Security

You can view [Isracard's security policy](https://www.mastercard.co.il/he-il/vision/privacy/fraud-security-privacy.html). Payment using Apple Pay is secured by the most advanced encryption software and is based on the EMV global standard for securing digital payment transactions. By using the Google Pay service you benefit from a more secure payment with the most stringent transaction security assurance standards (the EMV global standard).



### Transaction Limits

A large debit card transaction cannot be split into installments because a debit card does not have a debit card limit and is an instant debit. The debit card limit cannot be increased because a debit card does not have a limit, it can be used subject to a balance to be used on the account. Withdrawals can be made, subject to a sufficient balance, up to 5,000 ILS in total per day in Debit Card. Additionally, transactions can be conducted based on the account balance, up to 3,000 ILS per single transaction. For transactions exceeding 3,000 ILS, the Debit Card must be used multiple times. Currently, it is not possible to increase the credit withdrawal limit on the card beyond the existing limits based on the card type. Debit cards allow withdrawals of up to 5,000 ILS per day, while credit cards can be used for withdrawals up to 10,000 ILS in two installments. If you wish to make a payment in installments for a charge already made to the credit card, this service can be provided by the credit card company for the number of installments you desire easily and conveniently on the [Isracard website/app](https://web.isracard.co.il/debtinstallments). If you need more information about why you have duplicate transactions on your debit card, contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent).



### PIN Code Recovery

If you want to recover the PIN code for your Credit Card or Debit Card, you can do so using the [Isracard app or website](https://digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/secretcoderenewal/#) or contact Isracard at 03-6364513.

### Need For Card Transaction Approval By PIN Code For Security

Approving cards transactions with a PIN code is necessary to secure the use in your cards, but isn't always required:
* Transactions that require the card's PIN code - These are transactions carried out at a business using the physical card, depending on the transaction amount.
* Transactions that don't require the card's PIN code: Online transactions do not require a PIN code for approval. They are approved directly by the credit card company.



## Lost Phone or Device

### Dealing with Lost Devices Connected to Digital Wallets

Apple Pay only requires an active internet connection when adding a card to the service for the first time. Afterward, an active internet connection is not required in order to make a transaction at a business. If you lost your Apple Watch or any Apple device that had an Apple Pay charge card on it, you can suspend or permanently remove the option to pay with that lost or stolen watch from the [iCloud website](https://www.icloud.com) by connecting to the iCloud service or through the FindMy app installed on any other Apple device you have. The card will be suspended or removed (according to your choice) even if the lost watch is not connected to the internet at all. You can also contact Isracard at 03-6364400 for assistance with the matter. It is important to know that if you choose to suspend or remove the card from the service - this does not affect your physical card at all, and it will continue to operate unchanged.

## Card Design and Personalization

### Card Personalization

We currently offer two types of bank cards: a credit card and a debit card. The bank does not offer prepaid cards. The debit card, also known as a "direct" card, is limited to the available balance in the account. To determine which type of card is right for you, consider the objective of its use. If the card is for purchases and distribution of repayment into installments, a credit card might be suitable. This is in accordance with the line of credit allocated by the bank (subject to the credit policy and considerations). If the card is intended for purchases based on the available balance in the account, a debit card might be suitable. If you need help making the right decision, you can contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent).



### Card Design and Options

ONE ZERO debit cards on all subscription plans come in a luxurious and minimalist design in a smooth white color, with the card number imprinted on the back for maximum security and style. At this time, you cannot select the color of the card, or add a nickname to it. The ONE ZERO bank charge cards that appear on our app and in the digital wallets (Apple Pay and Google Pay) are black, but the actual physical cards that you receive are currently white with a matte finish. The card design has been created with great lengths to provide a minimalist, high-end design. This is why you received a white card. The bank has not yet made a decision about issuing a metal card. Updates on this matter will be provided later on.



### Metal Cards

You are waiting for the issuance of metal cards. A few hundred Founders who expressed trust, endless support and patience were promised to receive metal cards, but the bank has not yet made a decision on this matter, We will update you on this later on.



## Lost Card or Stolen Card

### Reporting Stolen Cards and Disputing Charges

If your card has been stolen or if someone's using your card, you must check whether any transactions have been made that you did not authorize. In case of disputed or fraudulent transactions, you can tap Additional Actions on the Cards page and then [Dispute a Charge](https://digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/Login/?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.isracard.co.il%2Fcardcancellation), which will take you to Isracard's website to complete the relevant form. If you would also like to cancel the card, you can do this on the credit card company's website by accessing Isracard's card cancellation page. If your credit card details have been stolen, the recommended action is to temporarily block the old card. You can do this by going to the [cards page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/cards), tapping More Actions, and then selecting Cancel Card on the onezerobank app. Alternatively, you can cancel the card via the [Isracard website](https://digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/Login/?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.isracard.co.il%2Fcardcancellation).



## Fixed Monthly Charge

### Fixed Monthly Charge for Cards
A fixed monthly charge cannot be applied to the ONE ZERO charge cards. A fixed charge is a feature that allows you to choose the amount you wish to pay monthly on your card, which can be useful during a specific time period when your expenses are higher than what you are able to pay. The definition of a fixed monthly amount is provided by [Isracard](https://d.isracard.co.il/5488). A fixed monthly charge can be set up for most non-bank credit cards. Before choosing to set up a fixed monthly charge, it is recommended to contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent) about how worthwhile it is. Very often there is a very high interest rate on fixed monthly charges. There are other financial solutions that might be more suitable for you than a fixed monthly charge. Your line of credit utilization percentage includes ongoing and installment transactions that occupy a part of the line of credit utilization percentage. Every examination of a credit application, such as an increase in the line of credit, is reviewed on each date of the customer's request anew in accordance with the bank's credit policy. Credit considerations, particularly providing a line of credit, vary from account to account and are determined as a result of the bank's credit policy. The bank is not obligated to increase its customers' lines of credit, and such a decision is an individual decision for each and every customer. A fixed charge is a feature that allows you to choose the amount you wish to pay monthly on your card, which can be useful during a specific time period when your expenses are higher than what you are able to pay.



## Card Details

### Finding your Card Details

The full number of your card can be seen on the back of the card at the very bottom below the account number. You can find your card's expiration date on the back of the card, below the magnetic strip, to the right of the CVV (3-digit of verification number). The CVV number (3-digit of verification number) of your card can be found on the back of the card in the center, to the left of the card's expiration date.



### Generate a CVV code without the physical card

Through [Isracard website](digital.isracard.co.il/personalarea/Login) you can generate the full details of your Card, such as the full card number, type, and CVV code. You can also access the details through Isracard's app.



## Line of Credit for Credit Cards

### Credit Scores
Bank credit card applications are approved by the bank and consist of a large number of different parameters, subject to the bank's discretion. Credit considerations, particularly providing a line of credit, vary from account to account and are determined as a result of the bank's credit policy. The bank is not obligated to increase its customers' lines of credit, and such a decision is an individual decision for each and every customer.



### Credit Card Charges vs. Bank Loans

A credit card and a loan are two different financial products. A credit card is a means of payment that allows you to make purchases in installments according to the allocated line of credit. A loan is the provision of a payment by the financial entity to the customer and monthly repayments by the customer. If you need assistance in finding the right product, you can contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent).



### Interest Charges for Late Credit Card Payment

Interest will be charged at the rate of P+8.1% in accordance with the bank's credit policy considerations in case of late credit card payment. Late payment of your debt on your card causes an irregularity in the bank account, which results in interest being incurred, a report being made to the Bank of Israel's credit database regarding the irregularity, the card being permanently frozen/canceled, and in certain cases the debit being returned due to non-sufficient funds.



### Understanding Credit Card Line of Credit

ONE ZERO Bank offers a credit card line of credit feature that defines the maximum amount you can borrow, determined by factors like creditworthiness and income. The full amount of a purchase places a hold on the line of credit on your credit card. For example, if you bought a washing machine that costs 3,000 ILS in 10 installments, the entire amount will be considered used on the line of credit, and each month the usage will decrease by the amount of the monthly installment. You can view the credit card line of credit in the app on the Cards page or on the Personal Profile page -> change [account's lines of credit page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/settings/od-limits), or through the [Isracard app or website](https://digital.isracard.co.il/).



### Exceeding credit card line of credit and Overdraft

Exceeding your credit card line of credit results in charges being reversed, which are reflected in the credit report, and is expected to have a negative impact on the report itself. To avoid this, you can apply for a credit card line of credit increase on the Personal Profile page -> [account's lines of credit page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/settings/od-limits). If for some reason you were unable to increase your credit card's line of credit from the account lines of credit page, you can try to submit a [manual request for line of credit](/actions/misgarot). For assistance in finding a solution to avoid an unarranged overdraft due to the card, you can contact a [private banker](/actions/attach_agent). Debit transactions made on the same day usually add up to one total charge. For more details, visit the Isracard website or app. In the future, you will be able to view the details on the cards page on our app.



### Encumbering Savings Account

Credit card line of credit applications are reviewed for each customer as a result of the bank's credit policy and considerations in accordance with their conduct in the accounts, which is an indication of financial strength and repayment capacity. The bank is not obligated to provide credit to its customers, and such a decision is an individual decision for each and every customer. It is not possible to encumber your savings account for the issuance of a credit card.



### Early Repayment, Freeing Up the Line of Credit

To free up your card's line of credit, you can choose to pay a particular transaction or all transactions on the card. The action will be executed within 2 business days and will appear in the account within 4 business days, or on the upcoming billing day (the 2nd/10th/15th/20th of the month, depending on the billing day you chose). If the credit card line of credit is insufficient for you, you can make an early repayment for the credit card transactions using our services or Isracard website or you can contact a private banker to make a new request. There must be a balance in the account until the debt is covered so that the account does not become overdrawn/exceeding, depending on the account status. Another option is to try to increase the credit card line of credit independently by going to My Profile -> Change [account's lines of credit page](https://app.tfd-bank.com/portfolio/settings/od-limits) -> Change Card Line of Credit. If for some reason you were unable to increase your credit card's line of credit from the Lines of Credit page, you can try to submit a [manual request for line of credit](/actions/misgarot).

You can execute transactions with your credit card according to its line of credit and its balance, which are determined by the bank when you order the card. Please note, there is a daily limit of 10,000 ILS for withdrawing.



### Card refund Affect On Lines of Credit

When a refund is received for the card, it is offset by the charges received so that at the time of monthly billing, your account will be charged a lower amount than it should have been charged by the amount of the refund. In the event that no purchases were made on the card and no refund is offset against charges, the refund will be reflected in the account transactions, depending on the type of card.



### Installment Transactions on Credit Card

When a customer makes an installment transaction, the original amount is held on the credit card line of credit until all payments are made. The credit card line of credit refers to the maximum amount you can use, which includes the sum of all transactions you made on the card in the current month and previous debt, such as installment transactions that have not yet been charged. For instance, if your credit card line of credit is 10,000 ILS, you can make numerous transactions that reach this maximum amount. The division of a credit card transaction into installments is done with the business, and there is no limit to it on the part of the bank or the credit card company. You can view your lines of credit on the My Profile page under the Change Account Overdraft Limit section. In the Cards tab, you can see the credit card's line of credit by tapping the 3 dots.

### Increasing Line of Credit

Every examination of a credit application, such as an increase in the line of credit, is reviewed on each date of the customer's request anew in accordance with the bank's credit policy. Credit considerations, particularly providing a line of credit, vary from account to account and are determined as a result of the bank's credit policy. The bank is not obligated to increase its customers' lines of credit, and such a decision is an individual decision for each and every customer. When the line of credit on your card is changed, the updated line of credit balance will appear within 1 business day from the moment the line of credit is updated in the bank's systems. To change the credit card line of credit, only one cardholder's approval is needed.

Contacting a private banker will not necessarily lead to a higher line of credit than one that relies on your financial activity and data.

### Checking Account Overdraft Limit vs. Credit Card Line of Credit

An overdraft limit and a credit card line of credit are two different products. An overdraft limit allows you to manage debit balances in the account up to the amount of the limit. The overdraft limit allocation fee is collected quarterly, while with us all customers have an exemption for the allocation of an overdraft limit. A credit card line of credit allows you to use your credit card up to the amount allocated to you by the bank and make purchases on the card, whether in an installment transaction or not, up to the line of credit amount. The total amount you can spend on a credit card is determined by the line of credit; a line of credit is the maximum amount of transactions you can make on the card in a billing month. If the credit card line of credit is exceeded, you cannot perform transactions. You can view your lines of credit on the My Profile page under the Change Account Overdraft Limit section.

## Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards Similarities and Differences

### Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards comparison

Debit Cards:
* Use of a debit card is dependent on the available checking account balance.
* A debit card is charged immediately and cannot be used for paying in installments, as installments are payments charged over time.

Credit Cards:
* Use of a credit card depends on the line of credit, not the available checking account balance.
* By credit card, payment is on the monthly billing day (you can choose between the 2nd, 10th, 15th, 20th) and payments can be made divided into installments.



### Credit and Debit Card Differences

A credit card is a card that allows you to make transactions using the card and consolidate the charge to a single date each month. To make a transaction using the card, you must ensure that the credit card line of credit is sufficient for the transaction. Transactions are billed automatically once a month from the checking account, freeing the billed amount from the line of credit. A debit card is a card that can be used for immediate payment. To pay for a particular product or service, the debit card requires an available balance in your account, which is the checking account balance that appears in the app. Future balances, such as a cheque that was deposited but has not yet been approved, cannot be used to carry out transactions. A debit card deducts charges immediately from your checking account. It is a card with no debit card limit and operates based on the balance in the account. Transactions and withdrawals can be made through it. The maximum amount for a single transaction or withdrawal is 3,000 ILS. If a higher amount is required, the card can be charged multiple times. Debit card charges are deducted from the account on an ongoing basis, but transactions made on the card wait three business days for final approval before they are actually charged, therefore, the amount of the transactions is reserved on the account. Debit transactions made on the same day usually add up to one total charge. You can view the full details of the transactions on the Isracard website/app 48 hours after the execution of the transaction.



### Debit card billing and limits

Debit cards are regularly debited from the account, but transactions made on the card wait for final approval 3 business days until they are actually charged and therefore reserve funds from line of credit. Debit transactions made on the same day usually add up to one total charge. The full details of transactions can be viewed on the Isracard website/app 48 hours after the execution of the transaction. Your debit card deducts charges immediately from your checking account after the payment. Debit card charges are deducted from the account on an ongoing basis, but transactions made on the card wait 3 business days for final approval before they are actually charged, therefore, the amount on the account is reserved.



### Double Charges and Unrecognized Charges in Debit Card

If you see a double charge and/or an unrecognized charge in your account and you are using a Debit card, it is important for us to update you of a few things: A Debit card is an immediate debits card that relies on the available balance in the account, performing transaction in this card will be immediately reflected in the app under "Non-Final Movements". The transaction charge is definitively descending from the account within 4-5 business days. Charges that appear as "double" or "unrecognized" are likely temporary (up to 24 hours) and are pending the final approval of the transaction in the bank's systems. We recommend that you regularly monitor your account and wait before contacting us regarding unrecognized or double charges.



### Transaction Limits and Bank Rights in Debit Card

It is not possible to make transactions with the card that exceed the available balance in the account or the available credit limit in the account. For avoidance of doubt, it should be emphasized that the bank shall have the right to refuse a transaction.



### What is a credit card

Credit card is a payment instrument issued by banks and credit card companies. It allows the customer to make purchases at businesses and pay at a later date, as well as to receive loans and cash withdrawals. The use of the card usually involves different fees and interest.



### Credit card concepts and terms

* Revolving credit: A type of credit given to a customer when he does not pay the full balance on the card by the time he is charged. The unpaid amount rolls over to the next month, plus interest. This method allows the customer to spread the payment over time, but it can be expensive due to interest accumulation. Bank cards do not have this method of payment.
* Installment transactions: An option given to the customer to spread the payment for an expensive purchase into several (usually monthly) equal payments. Interest is often charged on future payments, but some promotions can be deployed interest-free. The spread of payments makes large purchases more accessible, but on the other hand may create a strain on the budget in the future.
* Abnormal Action Verification: A process designed to verify that an unusual action on the card (e.g., an extraordinarily high transaction or unusual location) is performed by the cardholder. Verification can be done through a phone call, a text message with a one-time code, or even a requirement for an ID card. The purpose of the process is to prevent misuse of the card in case of theft or fraud. This verification is most often carried out by the credit card company.
* Card Number (PAN): The primary credit card identification number, stamped on the physical card and encoded on the magnetic stripe or chip on it. The number includes up to 16 digits - 6 prefix digits identifying the issuer, up to 9 digits of the customer's unique account number, and last check digit. This number is used to verify and execute transactions in Israel and abroad.
* International credit card: A credit card that enables transactions abroad or in foreign currency, thanks to cooperation between credit card companies and international clearing networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Using an international card may save conversion fees, and is necessary for placing orders from foreign sites or while abroad.
* Credit threshold: the maximum amount that can be charged in a single transaction without obtaining special approval from the credit company. If the transaction amount exceeds the threshold, individual verification or authorization will be required before the charge is complete. The threshold is intended to protect the customer and the credit card company from exceptional or unauthorized charges, which may indicate theft or misuse of the card.
* Rechargeable credit card: A credit card that can be deposited (recharged) a sum of money in advance, and redeemed up to the amount charged only. This is a prepaid card and not credit in the usual sense, since it does not give the client the ability to accumulate debt. Such cards are useful for controlling expenses or making safe and limited payments in advance. The bank does not have a prepaid card.
* Virtual credit card: A credit card that does not physically appear on plastic, but exists digitally. The virtual card is specifically allocated for online shopping only, and its details are stored securely. This card can be used without fear of revealing the real card details, and it is easier to replace it in case of loss or fear of misuse.
